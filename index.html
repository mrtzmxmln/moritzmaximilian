                    technik and a second one at nbv club gmbh - we had a blast organising our class project 'querdenker
                    - das
                    schulduell' and furthermore lucky me was chosen to have a talk with industry leading ceos, to name

                    happenings

                    in 2022 i gathered with some friends, to translate the idea of creating an open and safe space for
                    people interested in experimental, avant-garde electronic music and the scene around it, into
                    reality - as a collective we managed and hosted three outstanding events with great success for art
                    and culture in the city of osnabrueck and beyond - have you been there?

                    since my youth i dreamed about leading gathered souls into emotional heights with the power of music
                    because for me "music is the answer" - what shall i say… some dreams come true if you work hard for
                    it while withstanding all the headwind!
